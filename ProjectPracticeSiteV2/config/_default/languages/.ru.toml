### Проект по разработке сайта-сервиса для более удобной и интуитивно понятной работы над проведением остаточных знаний в университете.
___


Долгое время проведение остаточных знаний считалось трудоёмким процессом: преподавателям и администрации прходится заполнять много отчётов и бумаг, согласовывать даты проведения проверки, а также выбирать группы для прохождения тестирования. На все эти действия из-за нехватки единого ресурса, тратится много времени и сил. **Этот проект спешит исправить ситуацию и предоставить сотрудникам университета удобную систему для проведения остаточных знаний.**
